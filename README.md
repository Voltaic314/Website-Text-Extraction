# Website-Text-Extraction
This extracts the text from a website. Ideal for passing it into a language model for processing and summarization. 

This repository is a collection of scripts used to help with extracting body text from a website (like an article) and then writing it to a text file.

This text can then be passed into an LLM of your choosing to summarize the text, train it, whatever you want. I intended to use this for finance related purposes.
Like summarizing an article posted for investors or summarizing a new news article to help with trading algorithms. 

Ideally in a perfect world you'd get real world news from a news API of some kind, that would be much faster and more efficient than parsing and summarizing all of the HTML body text of a website.
