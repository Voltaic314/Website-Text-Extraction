Here is the text from the website itself: 
TheUniversity of Arizona has partnered withTheDream.USto improve access to higher education for Arizona’s undocumented youth. 
In its10-year history, TheDream.US has providedthousands of scholarshipsto help non-citizen students,with or without Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals policy or temporary protected status, get a degree from one of the program’s 80+ partner schools. As of the 2024-2025 school year, the UA will be one of these schools. 
Applications for the national scholarship opened onNov. 1, and the deadline is Feb. 29, 2024.This scholarship provides up to $33,000 towards a bachelor’s degree at partner schools in states where undocumented students are eligible for in-state tuition, which includes Arizona as of 2022. 
“We believe that everyone, regardless of their status, should have equitable access to a college education and a meaningful career post graduation,” saidNicole Wesley, senior program manager of career supports at TheDream.US. 
Wesley explained that partner schools must have existing infrastructure to support undocumented students and commit additional resources to accepted scholars. 
“Once they get their scholarship from TheDream.US, we then fill in any remaining need that might be there to cover their resident tuition and mandatory fees,”Rafael Meza, senior director for enrollment management at the UA, said. 
Applicantsmust apply to the scholarship online and to the partner university for admission as well. They will be notified by TheDream.US inAprilif they are selected. 
“This partnership is reflective of the broader university commitment to help our Arizona residents be as prepared as possible to meet the cost of tuition at the University of Arizona,” Meza said. 
According to Meza, the first cohort of UA recipients is expected to consist of 10 students. Support for these scholars will include designated contacts in various departments across campus. 
“Part of why we’re a good match for them is we have had a history of supporting undocumented and DACAmented students through the last few years,” saidKarla Cruze-Silva,the UA’s associate director forHispanic Serving Institution Initiatives. 
Cruze-Silva explained that the scholarship furthers existing efforts on campus to provide assistance to undocumented students, such as theUA President’s Directed Scholarshipand theImmigrant Student Resource Center. 
“This is a way for us to actually live out the mission of a land-grant, of being an HSI, of trying to create a more inclusive and accessible space,” Cruze-Silva said. 
Jessica Martinez,the coordinator of immigrant student support at theThrive Center,will also serve as a scholarship advisor and will meet with the selected students and help them navigate university resources. The Thrive Center already offersmentorship, workshops, social events and more for students. 
“It definitely opens doors to our undocumented students,” Martinez said about the scholarship. “It makes the dream possible.”
